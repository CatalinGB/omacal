//! Search: the query half. The overlay is Task 2.
//!
//! Three layers, and the split is the same one `notify_loop` uses: the store
//! answers *which events match* (`omacal_store::search_events` — titles, and
//! only calendars the user displays), `omacal_core::search` answers *which
//! occurrence and in what order* against a clock it is handed, and this file
//! joins them. **Tasks are the fourth piece**: an open task has no
//! occurrence, so it is matched here in Rust and ordered by due date, and the
//! two kinds travel as two arrays — see [`SearchResults`].
//!
//! **No write path, no network** (spec §7). This is a `SELECT` and some
//! arithmetic. A search that synced first would be slow and surprising, and a
//! search that could change an event would be a second way to do what the
//! popover already does with every guard it has.
